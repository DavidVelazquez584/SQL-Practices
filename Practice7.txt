**Cleaning Data**
-----

Fisrt it is need to import from a csv file all data

----

Then finding duplicates with GROUP BY and HAVING as shown in the following query: 
SELECT company,
       street,
       city,
       st,
       count(*) AS address_count
FROM meat_poultry_egg_establishments
GROUP BY company, street, city, st
HAVING count(*) > 1
ORDER BY company, street, city, st;

----

Then finding missing data, which are the ones who have null values using WHERE by doing the following query:
SELECT establishment_number,
       company,
       city,
       st,
       zip
FROM meat_poultry_egg_establishments
WHERE st IS NULL;

----

Then there is added a constraint in some columns by the following query: 
SELECT st,
       count(*) AS st_count
FROM meat_poultry_egg_establishments
WHERE length(zip) < 5
GROUP BY st
ORDER BY st ASC;

----

Then, for fixing the data, a backup table is required by doing the following query: 
Create table backup as select Select * from originalTable;

Then is recommended to create a new column and work in that column with the fix of the missing st values

---- 

Then for delete duplicates, it is need to make a function to find out those duplicates and keep the important 
ones by doing the following query: 
delete from meat_poultry_egg_establishments
where establishment_number not in (
    Select max(establishment_number)
    from meat_poultry_egg_establishments
    group by company, street, city, st
);

---- 
Finally there is required to do the transactions, by doing database operations, rollback and commit, which
are important when we need to update the table, like the following query: 
START TRANSACTION 
update meat_poultry_egg_establishments
SET company = 'Gdl'

SELECT company,* FROM meat_poultry_egg_establishments

ROLLBACK;
COMMIT;
